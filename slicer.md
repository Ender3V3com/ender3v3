# Slicers

A slicer is an essential part of the 3D printing process. What it does is it takes your file (.stl, .step) file that you want to print and creates a .gcode file (toolpaths) for your printer to run (follow).

There are a lot of slicers that work with the Ender 3 V3 SE, such as Cura, Creality Print, Simplify3D, but we recommend PrusaSlicer for Marlin (stock firmware) and OrcaSlicer for Klipper.

You can download it from [here](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/). 
To install and configure the printer, you need to:
- get the .exe file and run it, installing the slicer (go with the recommended settings)
- open PrusaSlicer
