# Firmware

## Firmware Overview

The **Ender 3 V3 SE** runs on Creality's proprietary [firmware](https://www.creality.com/pages/download-ender-3-v3-se/), built on a customized version of [Marlin Firmware](https://marlinfw.org/). It is designed for ease of use while optimizing the printer's hardware capabilities, including automatic bed leveling and a colorful 3.2" display as user interface. 

### Pros
- **Pre-configured for Out-of-the-Box Use**: No additional setup is required, making it ideal for beginners.
- **Supports CR Touch Auto-Leveling**: Ensures accurate first layers with minimal effort.
- **Touchscreen-Friendly UI**: Offers a clean and intuitive interface for controlling the printer.
- **OTA Updates (Optional)**: Allows for seamless firmware updates when connected to Creality Cloud.
- **Stable and Reliable**: Tuned for the specific hardware of the Ender 3 V3 SE.

### Cons
- **Limited Customization**: Advanced users may find fewer options compared to third-party firmware like Klipper or vanilla Marlin.
- **Dependent on Creality Updates**: Bug fixes and new features rely on Creality's update schedule.
- **Basic Feature Set**: Lacks some advanced features (e.g., Pressure Advance) available in custom firmware (Klipper).

### Custom Firmware Compatibility
For those seeking greater flexibility, the Ender 3 V3 SE supports alternative firmware such as:
- **[Marlin](https://marlinfw.org/)**: The "open-source" base of Crealityâ€™s firmware, offering extensive configurability.
- **[Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/)**: Ideal for enthusiasts looking for high-speed printing and enhanced control.
